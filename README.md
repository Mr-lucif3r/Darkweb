The Dark Web originated in the mid-1990s with the creation of the Tor (The Onion Router) project by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, aimed at enabling secure, anonymous communications for government purposes. It later became open-source and publicly accessible, allowing users to browse the web anonymously using the Tor network.


While the dark web is often associated with illegal activities like drug trafficking and cybercrime, it also hosts legitimate uses, such as private communications for whistleblowers and journalists operating under oppressive regimes. Over time, it has evolved into a space marked by both privacy and secrecy, raising concerns over its potential for both good and bad uses.

The Dark Web today is a complex and multifaceted part of the internet. It is primarily accessed via the Tor network, which provides anonymity by routing traffic through multiple layers of encryption, making it difficult to trace user activity. While it remains a haven for privacy-focused users, the Dark Web is also infamous for illegal activities.

Privacy-Focused Services: Many users access the Dark Web for enhanced privacy, including encrypted communication platforms, search engines, and social media networks.
Despite efforts by law enforcement to crack down on illegal activities, the Dark Web continues to thrive, driven by its focus on anonymity and the protection of privacy. At the same time, it remains a space for legitimate concerns, such as digital rights and free speech in authoritarian contexts.
